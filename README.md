This is a 60 second timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals 

When you open the page it will ask if you want to start:

Once you have clicked start the timer will start decreasing and you will have a question and a series of answers to choose from:

If you answer incorrectly the timer will lose 10 seconds automatically and an indicator will appear

If you finish all the questions or run out of time you will be led to the score screen where you can enter in your initials and submit them to be saved on our high-scores list. You can only use 3 characters in this screen if you use more it will just use the first 3 for the High Score. Alternatively you can just refresh the page to try again without submitting your score:

Or you can push the "View High Scores" button and be led to our high scores page:

Here you can either delete a line item or delete all the scores and start building them up again. 

Good luck!
